- ran the command to launch the current version of gdb as recommended in the lab
gdb ~eggert/bin64/bin/emacs-25.2

- (gdb) break Ftimes
it set the break point at the function Ftimes that use to multiply number, that helps to trance every instruction in that function, 

-(gdb) ‘info b’ to check the break point 
Num     Type           Disp Enb Address            What
1       breakpoint     keep y   0x0000000000547ad0 in Ftimes at data.c:2815

-(gdb) set disassemble-next-line on
It helps to display the next source line followed by the disassembly of it after GDB is 
stopped at a breakpoint. 

- (gdb) set step-mode on
It causes the step command to stop at the first instruction of a function which contains
no debug line information rather than stepping over it.

- (gdb) stepi (or si)
used to go inside the function

- (gdb) info registers
used to get the all registers information, e.g to see the value of the registers

- (gdb) info registers $___
used to get the value for the specific registers

- (gdb) disas
It produce the disassembly output of the entire function



As i was tracing, general pattern i used was
1.) gdb ~eggert/bin64/bin/emacs-24.5
2.) break Ftimes
3.) set disassemble-next-line on
4.)set step-mode on
5.) disas
6.) si
7.) info registers
8.) info registers $___
